# Ethereum Data Analytics: Exploring the Ethereum Blockchain

With over $385 billion in market capitalization (as of 31st August, 2021), Ethereum is the largest public blockchain that supports smart contracts. It is also the second most valuable cryptocurrency, just after Bitcoin.

In this work, we have done exploratory data analysis of the Ethereum blockchain. We started by giving an overview of the Digital Ledger Technology and then explained several consensus mechanisms. Further, we described blockchain technology and gave an explanation of how it works. Then we stated the different types of blockchains being used in the industry today. A detailed description of the Ethereum blockchain is then given by deeply talking about the Ethereum model and the Ethereum Roadmap. After that, the data analysis setup is reported and the dataset schema is presented along with a dataset relational diagram.
Further, we move on to the analytics and provide a generic analytics of the Ethereum blockchain related to transactions, gas, addresses, smart contracts and ETH price. Finally, we present a focused analytics of transactions, volume, accounts and smart contracts.
